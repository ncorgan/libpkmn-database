LibPKMN Database
===============================================

LibPKMN (https://github.com/ncorgan/libpkmn) uses Veekun's extensive Pok√©dex project
(https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) in the form of a SQLite database compiled
as part of LibPKMN's build process. A text dump of the database is stored in this
repository, which is used as a submodule of the primary repository.

Files:
 * **veekun-pokedex:** direct dump of Veekun database
 * **libpkmn-additions:** LibPKMN-specific additions to database
 * **libpkmn-form-names:** Form names used in LibPKMN
 * **libpkmn-compat-num:** this must match compat number of LibPKMN build to be used
